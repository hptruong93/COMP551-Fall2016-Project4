# COMP551-Fall2016-Project4
4th project for COMP 551 Fall 2016

# To run the code
## In general
Most functionalities can be run by invoking $python main.py -t <xx> where xx is the task number. The main task is number 7 where the script will go through the entire data pipeline and report performance on the models specified in the according section of the file main.py

## K-means
Code for running K-means clustering can be found under folder kmean. Similar to main.py, kmean.py has several tasks that can be invoked to access the functionalities.

## Ant-colony
A shebang allows ant_colony_clusterer_v4.py to be executed directly.  Despite parallel implementation the ant-colony still takes exceeding long to run.  Shorter neighborhood sizes and lower iterations will reach completion, albiet with impaired clusters.  

## RNN
run $python rnn_example.py

Data set: Common Eider Petersen Alaska 2000-2009
